# Operationalizing Machine Learning 

The main goal of this project is to configure a cloud-based machine learning **production** model, deploy it, and consume it as well as enable workflows automation via pipelines.

The dataset used for this project is the [BankMarketing](https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv) based on [UCI BankMarketing](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).  It is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The **classification** goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

The main key steps of this project would be the following ones:

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. Consume the model endpoints
7. Create, Publish and Consume a pipeline

A further documentation and explanations around each main steps will be provided: 15 minutes screencast + all process screenshots.

## Architectural Diagram

The followin architectural diagram describes various stages that are critical to the overall flow.

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
